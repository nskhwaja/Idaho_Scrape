# Idaho_Scrape
I am able to scrape the pure HTML off the site, however am stuck on the nested loop section in the "idaho_pharmacists2" py file. I am having difficulty getting the HTML file to output specific variables. For reference to how I code in Python feel free to check out my "lineup prediction" and "NFL fines" repositories.
